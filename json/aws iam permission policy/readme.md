This is a JSON-formatted AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy document. The policy grants permission to perform the s3:GetBucketLocation and s3:ListAllMyBuckets actions on the Amazon S3 bucket with the ARN arn:aws:s3:::test-deploy-artifacts and all S3 buckets, respectively. This means that any IAM user or role that the policy is attached to will have permission to get the location of the test-deploy-artifacts bucket and to list all of the S3 buckets that they have access to. This policy is an example and can be customized to grant different permissions on different resources.
